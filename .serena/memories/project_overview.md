MLAudioClassifier classifies drum audio samples into instrument categories using machine learning. The repo includes Jupyter notebooks for MFCC feature extraction, CNN and autoencoder-based training, evaluation, and a practical demo for sorting sample libraries. Processed datasets, trained models, and scripts for directory setup and archive organization are stored in dedicated folders.
