# Further optimisations

## Task

indentify opportunities for optimisations and improvements that can be made to each section of the notebook, working top-to-bottom in sequential order.

## Goal

The goal of the notebook series is to produce a copy of complete_drum_archive, with a mirrored directory structure containing sorted subfolders where previously there were loose files.

## Summary of Heuristics

The current method is by using ML to learn the categories of sounds in the drum archive to identify and group samples.

**Optimise this workflow.**

## Results

A thoroughly optimised #file:AllInOne_DrumClassifier.ipynb notebook
