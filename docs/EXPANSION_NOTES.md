# MLAudioClassifier - Expansion to 6 Classes

## Overview

The MLAudioClassifier has been expanded from 3 classes (kick, snare, hi-hat) to 6 classes to include all major drum kit percussion instruments.

## New Classification Classes

The system now classifies the following 6 instrument types:
0. **Crash** - Crash cymbals

1. **Hihat** - Hi-hat cymbals  
2. **Kick** - Kick drums
3. **Ride** - Ride cymbals
4. **Snare** - Snare drums
5. **Tom** - Tom drums

## Files Modified

### 1. Model1_Train.ipynb

- **Change**: Updated output layer from 3 to 6 classes
- **Line**: Changed `keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')` to `keras.layers.Dense(6, activation='softmax')`
- **Impact**: Model 1 now trains for 6-class classification

### 2. Model2_Train.ipynb  

- **Change**: Updated output layer from 3 to 6 classes
- **Line**: Changed `keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')` to `keras.layers.Dense(6, activation='softmax')`
- **Impact**: Model 2 now trains for 6-class classification

### 3. Model_Evaluation.ipynb

- **Changes**: Updated confusion matrix labels for both models
- **Model 1**: Updated tick labels to include all 6 classes
- **Model 2**: Updated tick labels to include all 6 classes
- **Impact**: Evaluation now shows performance across all 6 instrument types

### 4. PracticalDemo.ipynb

- **Changes**:
  - Added creation of 3 additional folders (Crash, Ride, Tom)
  - Updated classification logic to handle labels 0-5
  - Added file organization for all 6 classes
- **Impact**: Demo now sorts samples into 6 instrument-specific folders

### 5. README.md

- **Change**: Updated roadmap section to reflect expanded capabilities
- **Impact**: Documentation now accurately describes 6-class classification

### 6. MFCC_Feature_Extractor.ipynb

- **Changes**: Added documentation comments clarifying 6-class support
- **Impact**: Better user understanding of the expanded scope

## Data Requirements

The existing TrainingData/ and TestData/ folders already contain the required subfolders:

- Crash/
- Hihat/
- Kick/
- Ride/
- Snare/
- Tom/

No changes to the data structure are needed - the MFCC_Feature_Extractor.ipynb will automatically process all available classes.

## Training Impact

- **Model Complexity**: Output layer increased from 3 to 6 neurons
- **Training Time**: May increase slightly due to additional classes
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal increase due to small change in model size
- **Data Balance**: Ensure roughly equal samples per class for best performance

## Usage Workflow (Updated)

1. Run `MFCC_Feature_Extractor.ipynb` - processes all 6 classes
2. Run `Model1_Train.ipynb` - trains 6-class CNN on MFCC features  
3. Run `Model2_Train.ipynb` - trains 6-class autoencoder+CNN on spectrograms
4. Run `Model_Evaluation.ipynb` - evaluates both models on 6 classes
5. Run `PracticalDemo.ipynb` - demonstrates 6-class sample organization

## Next Steps

1. Retrain both models with the updated architectures
2. Evaluate performance on the expanded 6-class problem
3. Adjust hyperparameters if needed for optimal 6-class performance
4. Update any additional documentation or examples
